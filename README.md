# Login Example with React, Axios, and React Router DOM

This repository contains a basic example of a login implementation using **React**, **Axios**, and **React Router DOM**. The login flow authenticates a user and stores the JWT token in the **local storage** for session persistence. This setup is designed to demonstrate how to manage a simple login system in a frontend React application without backend code.

## Features

- **React** for building the user interface.
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests to a sample authentication endpoint.
- **React Router DOM** for handling page navigation.
- **JWT storage** in local storage for maintaining user sessions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the application with `npm start`.
4. The app will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Important Notes

- This example only covers the frontend implementation; the backend should handle JWT generation and validation.
- For security reasons, storing JWTs in local storage is suitable for demonstration purposes. In production, consider more secure storage methods.
